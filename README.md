# RTED FUN 🎭 - Real-Time Emotion Detection with Fun Reactions & Games

**RTED FUN** is a fun and interactive real-time emotion detection project built with Flask and OpenCV. It features **two exciting modes**:

1. **Emotion Reaction Mode (`app1.py`)** – Detects user emotions in real time and responds with matching **emojis** and **songs**.
2. **Emotion Mimic Game (`app.py`)** – Challenges the user to mimic randomly selected emotions and checks if their expression matches!


RTED-FUN (Real-Time Emotion Detection – FUN Edition) is an interactive web application that combines real-time emotion recognition with engaging visual and audio reactions. Using a webcam and a trained CNN model, the app detects facial emotions and either reacts with matching emojis and emotion-specific songs or challenges users to mimic displayed emotions as part of a fun game mode. Built with Flask, OpenCV, and deep learning, RTED-FUN aims to make emotion AI both entertaining and educational, offering users a playful way to explore emotion detection technology.
